## Welcome to our ERC20 token selling web3 platform developed with Hardhat and Next.js

### Features:

- **ERC20 Token Sales:** Facilitates the selling of ERC20 tokens through a decentralized platform.
- **Solidity Smart Contracts:** Employs Solidity for writing and deploying Ethereum smart contracts, ensuring robust and secure token functionality.
- **Hardhat:** Utilizes Hardhat for developing and testing Ethereum smart contracts, ensuring reliability and security.
- **Next.js Frontend:** Employs Next.js for building a dynamic and efficient user interface.

## Project Overview:

This project is a decentralized platform for selling ERC20 tokens. Users can interact with smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to purchase tokens securely and transparently.

### How to Develop Further:

1. **Clone the project repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/minhajhameed/web3-ECR20-token.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd web3-ECR20-token
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Compile and deploy smart contracts with Hardhat:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   npx hardhat deploy --network YOUR_NETWORK
   ```

5. **Start the Next.js frontend:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the web application:** Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

## Usage:

### 1. Connecting Wallet:

- Users can connect their Ethereum wallet (e.g., Metamask) to the platform to interact with smart contracts and purchase tokens.

### 2. Purchasing ERC20 Tokens:

- Once connected, users can browse available ERC20 tokens and purchase them using their connected wallet.
